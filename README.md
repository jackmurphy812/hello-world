# Introduction
Hi, my name is Jack. I am a data science major in my pre-junior year at Drexel University and expect to graduate in 2024. I have experience with Python and the data manipulation packages within it such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. I also have experience in HTML and CSS. While I have not taken a class in SQL, I am working on learning it by myself. Outside of school, I enjoy watching and playing sports. I have done a few Python projects on datasets about sports for school. In the future, I plan on doing more passion projects with analyzing data in sports and other topics to explore trends I am interested in.
